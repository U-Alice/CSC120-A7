- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

    The concept of Inheritance makes programming so much better because it reduces repetition of similar attributes and functionalities. The objects also have a much better structure. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    When I extended the Building superclass, the constructor warned me to call super(name, address, nFloors), so I had to add parameters name, address and nFloors to the class constructors even though the assignment didn’t specify that.

   I learned how to use new data structures like HashTables and it's nice that they have so many built in functions. To someone taking this course, I would recommend to think about the real-world scenarios that apply to the codes they are writing because that really helps with implementation of the logic.
